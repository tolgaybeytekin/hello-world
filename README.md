Hello to all!
I'm about 45 yo! Living in Turkey.

But I am not able to realise them by myself only. I need collaboration.
I am taking Harvards CS50-cource through edx.com.
Nope I am at week 3 till 4. But I thnink I will not succeed.
I need collaborators, friends that help me to realize my App-Ideas.
Please contact me here, where I can explain some my Ideas...
I will be thankfull...
